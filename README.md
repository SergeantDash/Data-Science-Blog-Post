## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Project Motivation
Hospital readmissions are a significant challenge, both financially and in terms of patient care. Nearly 20% of Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days, costing the healthcare system $20 billion annually. High readmission rates often signal suboptimal care, poor discharge planning, or gaps in post-hospital support.

To address this, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP), penalising hospitals with excessive readmissions. This has created an urgent need for data-driven strategies to predict and mitigate readmission risks.

This project aims to analyse the CMS HRRP dataset using the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology to answer three key questions:

1. What factors drive hospital readmissions?
2. Can we accurately predict readmission rates?
3. Can we classify hospitals at risk of high readmissions and penalties?

By leveraging machine learning regression and classification models, this study seeks to provide actionable insights that empower CMS hospitals to reduce readmissions, improve patient outcomes, and minimise financial penalties.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@yudeshsubas/a-deep-dive-into-hospital-readmission-reduction-2252ba8838c1).
